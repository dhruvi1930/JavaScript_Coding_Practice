## Exercises

### String Manipulations

1. **Reverse String**
   - Input a string and click the "Reverse" button to see the reversed string.

2. **Palindrome Check**
   - Input a string and click the "Palindrome" button to check if the string is a palindrome.

3. **Repeat Max Character**
   - Input a string and click the "Repeat Max Char" button to find the character that appears most frequently and the number of times it appears.

4. **Unique Characters Check**
   - Input a string and click the "Is Unique" button to check if all characters in the string are unique.

5. **Reverse Integer**
   - Input an integer and click the "Reverse Integer" button to see the reversed integer.

### Number Sequences

1. **FizzBuzz Generation**
   - Input a number and click the "Generate FizzBuzz" button to generate a FizzBuzz sequence up to the input number.

### Array Operations

1. **Chunked Array**
   - Input a number to define the chunk size and click the "Generate Chunked Array" button to create chunked arrays of a predefined array.

2. **Permutation Check**
   - Input two strings and click the "Is Permutation" button to check if the two strings are permutations of each other.
